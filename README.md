As a user, I want to shorten long links and track how many times they've been clicked.

#### Basic Details

* Start with just shortening a URL, like <a href='http://tinyurl.com/' target='_blank'>TinyURL</a>
* Then move on to tracking the clicks, like <a href='https://bitly.com/' target='_blank'>Google</a>
* Get creative with the format of your short links or just use some random characters; as long as it's unique

#### Advanced Details

* Allow users to register, like <a href='https://bitly.com/' target='_blank'>Bitly</a>
* *Hint: Using Rails? Check out the popular <a href='https://github.com/plataformatec/devise' target='_blank'>Devise Gem</a> for authentication*
* Allow users to customize their short links
